# Opting out of Telemetry Data Collection

The [hosted services](#hosted-services) are public, anonymous use services which do not provide an option to disable telemetry.

For [client integrations](#client-integrations), telemetry consent is managed by those tools and the decision to opt-in/out will have an impact on the type of data that is sent to the Devfile Registry.
Users that opt-out will not have their client collected data sent to the integration, however information about the type of client and its interactions with the Devfile Registry will be tracked.
